# Live Debugging Interview: "Production is Down"

## Mental Model
Live debugging interviews test your grace under fire, your systematic approach to isolating variables, and your knowledge of the Linux/Django/PostgreSQL stack. 

```text
[ Detect ] -> [ Triage (Impact/Scope) ] -> [ Mitigate (Stop the bleeding) ] -> [ Isolate Root Cause ] -> [ Permanent Fix ]
```

## Scenario 1: The "100% CPU" Nightmare

**The Setup:** "You are paged at 2 PM. The Datadog dashboard shows all Gunicorn workers are running at 100% CPU. API latency has spiked from 50ms to 30,000ms (timeout). The database CPU is relatively low (20%). What do you do?"

### Step 1: Initial Investigation (Information Gathering)
**Candidate Actions:**
- Check error rates: Are we returning 500s or just 502/504 (timeouts)?
- Check logs: Are there any infinite loop indicators or specific endpoints throwing errors?
- Look at APM (Application Performance Monitoring): Which endpoint is consuming the time?

**Interviewer Response:** "You see that the `/api/v1/export-users/` endpoint is taking 29 seconds and timing out. Errors are all 504 Gateway Timeouts from Nginx."

### Step 2: Isolation and Root Cause Hypothesis
**Candidate Actions:**
- I know the DB CPU is low, so it's not a slow query locking the DB.
- CPU is spiked on the app servers. This implies a Python-level issue: either a massive loop, loading too much data into memory (triggering garbage collection thrashing), or serialization overhead.
- "I'd look at the code for `/api/v1/export-users/`."

**Interviewer provides code:**
```python
def export_users_view(request):
    users = User.objects.all()
    # Serialize to CSV
    response = HttpResponse(content_type='text/csv')
    writer = csv.writer(response)
    for user in users:
        writer.writerow([user.id, user.email, user.profile.bio])
    return response
```

### Step 3: Identifying the Bug
**Candidate:**
1. **N+1 Query:** `user.profile.bio` triggers a DB query for every single user. However, DB CPU is low. Why?
2. **Memory Exhaustion:** `User.objects.all()` without `iterator()` or pagination loads *all* users into Python memory at once. If the user base recently grew, this will cause the server to swap or spend 100% CPU in garbage collection trying to allocate memory for million ORM objects.

### Step 4: Mitigation and Fix
**Mitigation (Immediate):**
"If the site is completely down, I would restart the Gunicorn workers to clear the blocked queues, and temporarily block traffic to `/api/v1/export-users/` at the Nginx layer so users can use the rest of the app."

**Permanent Fix:**
```python
def export_users_view(request):
    # 1. Use server-side cursors (iterator)
    # 2. Use select_related to fix N+1
    # 3. Only fetch needed fields (values_list is even better for CSV)
    
    response = HttpResponse(content_type='text/csv')
    writer = csv.writer(response)
    
    # Fast, low-memory execution
    users_data = User.objects.select_related('profile').values_list(
        'id', 'email', 'profile__bio'
    ).iterator(chunk_size=2000)
    
    for row in users_data:
        writer.writerow(row)
        
    return response
```
*(Even better answer: "A CSV export for a large table should be moved to a Celery background task and the user notified via email when it's ready, rather than blocking an HTTP worker.")*

## Scenario 2: The Silent Data Corruption

**The Setup:** "A customer complains that their account balance is randomly decreasing. They should have $100, but it shows $90, then $85, with no matching transactions in their history. How do you investigate?"

### The Triage
1. **Scope:** Is it one user or all users? (Let's say multiple users).
2. **Recent Deployments:** Were there any recent code changes touching the billing system?
3. **Database Audit:** Do the transaction logs (if they exist) sum up to the current balance?

### Identifying the Bug
This is a classic **Race Condition** indicator.
"I would search the codebase for anywhere the balance is updated manually."

**Interviewer provides code:**
```python
# tasks.py
def deduct_fee(user_id, amount):
    user = User.objects.get(id=user_id)
    user.balance = user.balance - amount
    user.save()
```

### The Fix
"This is a read-modify-write race condition. If two Celery workers run `deduct_fee` for the same user simultaneously, they both read `$100`. Worker A deducts $5 and saves `$95`. Worker B deducts $10 and saves `$90`. The $5 deduction from Worker A is overwritten and lost."

**Solution:**
```python
from django.db.models import F

def deduct_fee(user_id, amount):
    # F-expression shifts the math to the database layer, which is atomic
    User.objects.filter(id=user_id).update(balance=F('balance') - amount)
```

### 1.3 Transactional Outbox Pattern Event Bus (Staff/Principal Level)

                        │ Notification Svc    │
                        └─────────────────────┘
```
**Mental Model:** Dual-writes (saving to DB and publishing to Kafka) cause data inconsistencies if one fails. The Outbox Pattern solves this by writing the event to an `Outbox` table in the *same database transaction* as the domain update. A background process (like Debezium CDC) streams the outbox table to the Event Bus.

                                └─────────────────────┘
```
**Mental Model:** Never split a Big Ball of Mud directly into microservices. First, enforce domain boundaries in the Django codebase (Modular Monolith) with strict imports and separate database schemas. Once a module proves to have distinct scaling or lifecycle requirements, extract it into a separate service.

## 4. Basic Implementation vs Production-Hardened Code

### 🔴 BROKEN / AMATEUR IMPLEMENTATION
```python
# Anti-Pattern: Ticking Time Bomb
# 1. No timeouts - can hang forever
# 2. No retries
# 3. Blocking synchronous call inside a view
# 4. No circuit breaker
import requests
from django.http import JsonResponse

def process_payment(request):
    # DANGER: If third-party API is slow, Gunicorn workers will exhaust
    response = requests.post("https://api.external.com/pay", data={"amount": 100})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return JsonResponse({"status": "success"})
    return JsonResponse({"status": "failed"}, status=400)
```

### ✅ PRODUCTION-HARDENED (STAFF/PRINCIPAL LEVEL)
```python
# Production-Grade: Resilient, Async, Timeout-bound
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry
from django.http import JsonResponse
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def get_resilient_session():
    session = requests.Session()
    retries = Retry(
        total=3,
        backoff_factor=0.5,
        status_forcelist=[ 500, 502, 503, 504 ]
    )
    session.mount('https://', HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))
    return session

def process_payment(request):
    session = get_resilient_session()
    try:
        # 1. Always use timeouts! (Connect timeout, Read timeout)
        response = session.post(
            "https://api.external.com/pay", 
            data={"amount": 100},
            timeout=(3.0, 10.0) # 3s connect, 10s read
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return JsonResponse({"status": "success"})
        
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # 2. Log exact failure for forensics
        logger.error(f"[PAYMENT_FAILED] External API error: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        # 3. Graceful degradation
        return JsonResponse(
            {"status": "error", "message": "Payment provider temporarily unavailable"}, 
            status=503
        )
```

## X. Architecture Decision Record (ADR): System Design Trade-offs

### Context & Problem Statement
We need to design a high-throughput, low-latency system that guarantees data consistency while handling extreme traffic spikes. Should we scale up the RDBMS, use a NoSQL approach, or implement an event-driven CQRS pattern?

### Considered Options
1. **Vertical Scaling (Fat DB)** - Easy, but hard limits on scaling.
2. **Read Replicas + Caching (Redis/Memcached)** - Good for read-heavy, bad for write-heavy.
3. **Event-Driven CQRS with Kafka** - High complexity, ultimate scalability, eventual consistency.
4. **Sharded PostgreSQL (Citus)** - Operational overhead, good for multi-tenant.

### Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **Event-Driven CQRS with Kafka**.
* **Justification:** At Staff/Principal scale, decoupling writes (Commands) from reads (Queries) is mandatory. Django will write events to an Outbox, Kafka will distribute them, and materialized views (Elasticsearch/Redis) will serve reads.
* **Trade-offs:** We accept Eventual Consistency (UI must handle optimistic updates). Complexity increases due to CDC (Debezium) and schema registries.

### Real-World Interview Rubric (Principal Level)
- **Junior/Mid:** Focuses on ORM optimization and basic Redis caching.
- **Senior:** Discusses Read-Replicas, connection pooling (PgBouncer), and Celery queues.
- **Staff/Principal:** Identifies DB locks as the bottleneck, proposes Outbox Pattern, discusses Idempotency, and designs for cross-AZ fault tolerance.

## 15. The Complete Staff-Level Guide to Debugging Scenarios
This section contains a deep dive into the 30-Point Framework for Debugging Scenarios.

### 15.1 Real-World Trade-Offs Matrix
| Architecture Choice | Pros for Debugging Scenarios | Cons for Debugging Scenarios | Max Scale |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Monolithic Default  | Easy to deploy   | High coupling    | 1k RPS    |
| Microservice Extracted | Independent scaling | Network overhead | 10k RPS   |
| Event-Driven Kafka  | Eventual Consistency | High Complexity  | 100k+ RPS |
| Serverless / Lambda | Scale to zero    | Cold Starts      | 50k RPS   |

### 15.2 Comprehensive Pytest Suite for Debugging Scenarios
A production-grade system requires testing across all failure domains. Below is the definitive pytest suite for testing Debugging Scenarios against race conditions, network failures, and database locks.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.db import transaction, DatabaseError

@pytest.fixture
def setup_debugging_scenarios():
    return {"status": "initialized", "topic": "Debugging Scenarios"}

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_happy_path_debugging_scenarios(setup_debugging_scenarios):
    """Test the standard execution flow without errors."""
    result = perform_debugging_scenarios_action()
    assert result.status == "success"

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_race_condition_debugging_scenarios():
    """Simulate concurrent requests to ensure row locks (select_for_update) hold."""
    import threading
    
    exceptions = []
    def worker():
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Simulate the lock and process
                perform_debugging_scenarios_action()
        except Exception as e:
            exceptions.append(e)

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(5)]
    for t in threads: t.start()
    for t in threads: t.join()
    
    # 1 succeeds, 4 fail with concurrency exceptions
    assert len(exceptions) == 4

@patch('requests.post')
def test_network_timeout_debugging_scenarios(mock_post):
    """Ensure system degrades gracefully when upstream is slow."""
    import requests
    mock_post.side_effect = requests.exceptions.Timeout("Connection timed out")
    
    with pytest.raises(ServiceUnavailableError):
         perform_debugging_scenarios_action()
```

### 15.3 Multi-Environment Comparison
| Environment | State Management | Concurrency | Latency | Debugging Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Local Dev** | SQLite / Local Redis | Single-threaded | < 5ms | Use `pdb` / `ipdb`, inspect local logs. |
| **Docker Compose** | Containerized PG | Local Gunicorn | ~10ms | Docker exec, attach debugger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Ephemeral DBs | Parallel Pytest | ~50ms | View artifacts, capture stdout/stderr. |
| **Staging (EKS)** | RDS Multi-AZ | HPA, 5 pods | ~30ms | Datadog/New Relic APM tracing. |
| **Production (100k RPS)**| RDS Read Replicas | KEDA + HPA, 500 pods | ~25ms | Distributed tracing, log aggregation (ELK). |

### 15.4 Django Internal Execution Trace for Debugging Scenarios
To truly master Debugging Scenarios, you must understand how Django handles it at the framework level.

1. **WSGI/ASGI Entrypoint**: Gunicorn receives the HTTP request and hands it to Django's `WSGIHandler`.
2. **Middleware Chain**: The request passes through `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware.
3. **URL Routing**: `URLResolver` matches the path to the specific view for Debugging Scenarios.
4. **View Execution**:
   - Authentication & Permissions are verified.
   - Database queries are generated via the ORM. (Watch out for N+1 queries here!)
   - Context is passed to the Template or serialized via DRF.
5. **Database Transaction**: If `ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True` or `transaction.atomic()` is used, a `BEGIN` statement is executed.
6. **Response Generation**: The view returns an `HttpResponse`.
7. **Middleware Teardown**: Middleware processes the response (e.g., adding headers).
8. **DB Commit/Rollback**: The transaction is committed. If an exception occurred, it rolls back.

### 15.5 Ticking Time Bomb Anti-Patterns
🔴 **Anti-Pattern 1: Unbounded Queries in Debugging Scenarios**
```python
# Ticking Time Bomb: This works locally with 10 rows.
# In prod, with 10M rows, it crashes the database and exhausts memory.
data = list(MyModel.objects.all())
```
✅ **The Fix:** Pagination, chunking, or streaming.
```python
# Staff-level fix
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
paginator = Paginator(MyModel.objects.order_by('id'), 1000)
for page in paginator.page_range:
    process(paginator.page(page).object_list)
```

🔴 **Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Indexes for Debugging Scenarios**
Querying by a non-indexed column in PostgreSQL will result in a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`). On a large table, this causes high CPU usage and slow responses.
✅ **The Fix:** Use `db_index=True`, `Meta.indexes`, or `GinIndex` for JSONB fields.

### 15.6 Resolution Playbook for Severity-1 Incidents
When a SEV-1 incident strikes related to Debugging Scenarios, follow this strict playbook:
1. **Acknowledge & Escalate:** Announce on `#incident-response`. PagerDuty alerts should be silenced.
2. **Mitigate, Don't Fix:** Your goal is to stop the bleeding, not write the perfect patch.
   - Scale up replicas? `kubectl scale deploy --replicas=50 app-name`
   - Block traffic? Add a WAF rule blocking the abusive IP or User Agent.
   - Revert deployment? Run the rollback CI pipeline.
3. **Investigation:** Look at APM traces. Are DB queries taking 5 seconds? Is Redis evicting keys?
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Post-incident, write an ADR detailing *why* it happened (e.g., Cache Stampede, missing lock) and implement long-term fixes (Circuit Breaker, Outbox Pattern).

| Environment | State Management | Concurrency | Latency | Debugging Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Local Dev** | SQLite / Local Redis | Single-threaded | < 5ms | Use `pdb` / `ipdb`, inspect local logs. |
| **Docker Compose** | Containerized PG | Local Gunicorn | ~10ms | Docker exec, attach debugger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Ephemeral DBs | Parallel Pytest | ~50ms | View artifacts, capture stdout/stderr. |
| **Staging (EKS)** | RDS Multi-AZ | HPA, 5 pods | ~30ms | Datadog/New Relic APM tracing. |
| **Production (100k RPS)**| RDS Read Replicas | KEDA + HPA, 500 pods | ~25ms | Distributed tracing, log aggregation (ELK). |

### 15.4 Django Internal Execution Trace for Debugging Scenarios
To truly master Debugging Scenarios, you must understand how Django handles it at the framework level.

1. **WSGI/ASGI Entrypoint**: Gunicorn receives the HTTP request and hands it to Django's `WSGIHandler`.
2. **Middleware Chain**: The request passes through `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware.
3. **URL Routing**: `URLResolver` matches the path to the specific view for Debugging Scenarios.
4. **View Execution**:
   - Authentication & Permissions are verified.
   - Database queries are generated via the ORM. (Watch out for N+1 queries here!)
   - Context is passed to the Template or serialized via DRF.
5. **Database Transaction**: If `ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True` or `transaction.atomic()` is used, a `BEGIN` statement is executed.
6. **Response Generation**: The view returns an `HttpResponse`.
7. **Middleware Teardown**: Middleware processes the response (e.g., adding headers).
8. **DB Commit/Rollback**: The transaction is committed. If an exception occurred, it rolls back.

### 15.5 Ticking Time Bomb Anti-Patterns
🔴 **Anti-Pattern 1: Unbounded Queries in Debugging Scenarios**
```python
# Ticking Time Bomb: This works locally with 10 rows.
# In prod, with 10M rows, it crashes the database and exhausts memory.
data = list(MyModel.objects.all())
```
✅ **The Fix:** Pagination, chunking, or streaming.
```python
# Staff-level fix
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
paginator = Paginator(MyModel.objects.order_by('id'), 1000)
for page in paginator.page_range:
    process(paginator.page(page).object_list)
```

🔴 **Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Indexes for Debugging Scenarios**
Querying by a non-indexed column in PostgreSQL will result in a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`). On a large table, this causes high CPU usage and slow responses.
✅ **The Fix:** Use `db_index=True`, `Meta.indexes`, or `GinIndex` for JSONB fields.

### 15.6 Resolution Playbook for Severity-1 Incidents
When a SEV-1 incident strikes related to Debugging Scenarios, follow this strict playbook:
1. **Acknowledge & Escalate:** Announce on `#incident-response`. PagerDuty alerts should be silenced.
2. **Mitigate, Don't Fix:** Your goal is to stop the bleeding, not write the perfect patch.
   - Scale up replicas? `kubectl scale deploy --replicas=50 app-name`
   - Block traffic? Add a WAF rule blocking the abusive IP or User Agent.
   - Revert deployment? Run the rollback CI pipeline.
3. **Investigation:** Look at APM traces. Are DB queries taking 5 seconds? Is Redis evicting keys?
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Post-incident, write an ADR detailing *why* it happened (e.g., Cache Stampede, missing lock) and implement long-term fixes (Circuit Breaker, Outbox Pattern).


## 15. The Complete Staff-Level Guide to Debugging Scenarios
This section contains a deep dive into the 30-Point Framework for Debugging Scenarios.

### 15.1 Real-World Trade-Offs Matrix
| Architecture Choice | Pros for Debugging Scenarios | Cons for Debugging Scenarios | Max Scale |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Monolithic Default  | Easy to deploy   | High coupling    | 1k RPS    |
| Microservice Extracted | Independent scaling | Network overhead | 10k RPS   |
| Event-Driven Kafka  | Eventual Consistency | High Complexity  | 100k+ RPS |
| Serverless / Lambda | Scale to zero    | Cold Starts      | 50k RPS   |

### 15.2 Comprehensive Pytest Suite for Debugging Scenarios
A production-grade system requires testing across all failure domains. Below is the definitive pytest suite for testing Debugging Scenarios against race conditions, network failures, and database locks.

```python

from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.db import transaction, DatabaseError

@pytest.fixture

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_happy_path_debugging_scenarios(setup_debugging_scenarios):
    """Test the standard execution flow without errors."""
    result = perform_debugging_scenarios_action()
    assert result.status == "success"

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_race_condition_debugging_scenarios():
    """Simulate concurrent requests to ensure row locks (select_for_update) hold."""
    import threading
    
    exceptions = []
    def worker():
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Simulate the lock and process
                perform_debugging_scenarios_action()
        except Exception as e:
            exceptions.append(e)

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(5)]
    for t in threads: t.start()
    for t in threads: t.join()
    
    # 1 succeeds, 4 fail with concurrency exceptions
    assert len(exceptions) == 4

@patch('requests.post')
def test_network_timeout_debugging_scenarios(mock_post):
    """Ensure system degrades gracefully when upstream is slow."""
    import requests
    mock_post.side_effect = requests.exceptions.Timeout("Connection timed out")
    
    with pytest.raises(ServiceUnavailableError):
         perform_debugging_scenarios_action()
```
