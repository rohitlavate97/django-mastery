# Behavioral Interview Scenarios for Staff Engineers

## Mental Model
Behavioral interviews at the Staff/Principal level are not about "tell me your biggest weakness." They are about navigating complex human systems, resolving severe technical disputes, managing up, and handling catastrophe with calm leadership.

Use the **STAR** method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) but add an **L** (Learnings) for senior roles.

## Scenario 1: The Architectural Disagreement

**The Question:** "Tell me about a time you strongly disagreed with a peer or a manager on an architectural decision. How did you handle it?"

### What they are evaluating:
- Do you use data or ego to argue?
- Do you understand business trade-offs vs. technical purity?
- Can you "disagree and commit" if the decision doesn't go your way?

### The Principal-Level Response Strategy:
* **Situation:** We needed to build a real-time notification system. Another Senior Engineer wanted to introduce Kafka because "it's web-scale."
* **Task:** I believed Kafka was massive overkill for our current scale (5,000 users) and our team lacked JVM/Zookeeper operational experience.
* **Action:** I didn't attack the technology; I framed it around Operational Cost. I wrote an RFC comparing Kafka vs. Redis Pub/Sub (which we already had in our stack). I highlighted the maintenance hours, CI/CD changes, and hiring requirements for Kafka. I proposed a phased approach: use Redis now behind an interface, swap to Kafka later if throughput hits 10k msgs/sec.
* **Result:** The team aligned on Redis. We shipped in 2 weeks instead of 2 months.
* **Learning:** Always anchor technical debates to business metrics (time-to-market, maintenance cost) rather than technological superiority.

## Scenario 2: The Production Outage

**The Question:** "Describe a time you took down production or were involved in a major outage. How did you react?"

### What they are evaluating:
- Do you panic, or do you have a systematic debugging approach?
- Do you blame others ("QA missed it") or take ownership?
- Do you focus on repairing the *system* (tests, CI) rather than punishing the *human*?

### The Principal-Level Response Strategy:
* **Situation:** A database migration I wrote added a column with a default value to a table with 50 million rows in PostgreSQL.
* **Task:** Upon deployment, the table locked entirely, taking down the main API.
* **Action:** 
    1. *Mitigate:* Immediately alerted the incident channel, rolled back the deployment, and forcefully killed the hung PostgreSQL query via `pg_stat_activity` to release the lock.
    2. *Communicate:* Updated customer support with an ETA.
    3. *Investigate:* Realized that prior to Postgres 11, adding a default value rewrites the entire table.
* **Result:** Downtime was limited to 8 minutes.
* **Learning/Evolution:** We didn't blame anyone; we changed the system. I implemented `django-zero-downtime-migrations` in our CI pipeline to statically analyze migrations and block PRs that attempt table-locking operations. 

## Scenario 3: Mentoring and Leveling Up

**The Question:** "Tell me about a time you mentored a junior or mid-level engineer who was struggling."

### What they are evaluating:
- Empathy and patience.
- Ability to identify root causes of poor performance (is it lack of skill, lack of context, or personal issues?).
- Delegation skills.

### The Principal-Level Response Strategy:
* **Situation:** A mid-level engineer was consistently shipping code with edge-case bugs and their PRs were requiring 4-5 rounds of review.
* **Action:** I noticed their unit tests only covered the "happy path." Instead of nitpicking the PRs, I pair-programmed with them for an hour. I taught them a specific mental model: "Test the edges, not just the center." We built a checklist together for their desk.
* **Result:** Over three months, their defect rate dropped by 60%, and they eventually led a feature launch independently.

### 1.3 Transactional Outbox Pattern Event Bus (Staff/Principal Level)

                                   ▼ (2) CDC (Change Data Capture) via Debezium
                        ┌─────────────────────┐
                        │ Kafka / Event Bus   │
                        └──────────┬──────────┘
                                   │
                                   ▼ (3) Consume Event
                        ┌─────────────────────┐
                        │ Notification Svc    │
                        └─────────────────────┘
```
**Mental Model:** Dual-writes (saving to DB and publishing to Kafka) cause data inconsistencies if one fails. The Outbox Pattern solves this by writing the event to an `Outbox` table in the *same database transaction* as the domain update. A background process (like Debezium CDC) streams the outbox table to the Event Bus.

### 1.4 Monolith-to-Service Decomposition (Staff Level)

          │                     │ └───────────────┘   │            └────────────────┘
┌─────────▼───────────┐         └─────────┬───────────┘
│ Single PostgreSQL   │                   │
└─────────────────────┘         ┌─────────▼───────────┐
                                │ Single PostgreSQL   │
                                │ (Schema per Module) │
                                └─────────────────────┘
```
**Mental Model:** Never split a Big Ball of Mud directly into microservices. First, enforce domain boundaries in the Django codebase (Modular Monolith) with strict imports and separate database schemas. Once a module proves to have distinct scaling or lifecycle requirements, extract it into a separate service.

## 4. Basic Implementation vs Production-Hardened Code

### 🔴 BROKEN / AMATEUR IMPLEMENTATION
```python
# Anti-Pattern: Ticking Time Bomb
# 1. No timeouts - can hang forever
# 2. No retries
# 3. Blocking synchronous call inside a view
# 4. No circuit breaker
import requests
from django.http import JsonResponse

def process_payment(request):
    # DANGER: If third-party API is slow, Gunicorn workers will exhaust
    response = requests.post("https://api.external.com/pay", data={"amount": 100})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return JsonResponse({"status": "success"})
    return JsonResponse({"status": "failed"}, status=400)
```

### ✅ PRODUCTION-HARDENED (STAFF/PRINCIPAL LEVEL)
```python
# Production-Grade: Resilient, Async, Timeout-bound
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry
from django.http import JsonResponse
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def get_resilient_session():
    session = requests.Session()
    retries = Retry(
        total=3,
        backoff_factor=0.5,
        status_forcelist=[ 500, 502, 503, 504 ]
    )
    session.mount('https://', HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))
    return session

def process_payment(request):
    session = get_resilient_session()
    try:
        # 1. Always use timeouts! (Connect timeout, Read timeout)
        response = session.post(
            "https://api.external.com/pay", 
            data={"amount": 100},
            timeout=(3.0, 10.0) # 3s connect, 10s read
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return JsonResponse({"status": "success"})
        
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # 2. Log exact failure for forensics
        logger.error(f"[PAYMENT_FAILED] External API error: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        # 3. Graceful degradation
        return JsonResponse(
            {"status": "error", "message": "Payment provider temporarily unavailable"}, 
            status=503
        )
```
\n\n
## X. Architecture Decision Record (ADR): System Design Trade-offs

### Context & Problem Statement
We need to design a high-throughput, low-latency system that guarantees data consistency while handling extreme traffic spikes. Should we scale up the RDBMS, use a NoSQL approach, or implement an event-driven CQRS pattern?

### Considered Options
1. **Vertical Scaling (Fat DB)** - Easy, but hard limits on scaling.
2. **Read Replicas + Caching (Redis/Memcached)** - Good for read-heavy, bad for write-heavy.
3. **Event-Driven CQRS with Kafka** - High complexity, ultimate scalability, eventual consistency.
4. **Sharded PostgreSQL (Citus)** - Operational overhead, good for multi-tenant.

### Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **Event-Driven CQRS with Kafka**.
* **Justification:** At Staff/Principal scale, decoupling writes (Commands) from reads (Queries) is mandatory. Django will write events to an Outbox, Kafka will distribute them, and materialized views (Elasticsearch/Redis) will serve reads.
* **Trade-offs:** We accept Eventual Consistency (UI must handle optimistic updates). Complexity increases due to CDC (Debezium) and schema registries.

### Real-World Interview Rubric (Principal Level)
- **Junior/Mid:** Focuses on ORM optimization and basic Redis caching.
- **Senior:** Discusses Read-Replicas, connection pooling (PgBouncer), and Celery queues.
- **Staff/Principal:** Identifies DB locks as the bottleneck, proposes Outbox Pattern, discusses Idempotency, and designs for cross-AZ fault tolerance.

This section contains a deep dive into the 30-Point Framework for Behavioral.

### 15.1 Real-World Trade-Offs Matrix
| Architecture Choice | Pros for Behavioral | Cons for Behavioral | Max Scale |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Monolithic Default  | Easy to deploy   | High coupling    | 1k RPS    |
| Microservice Extracted | Independent scaling | Network overhead | 10k RPS   |
| Event-Driven Kafka  | Eventual Consistency | High Complexity  | 100k+ RPS |
| Serverless / Lambda | Scale to zero    | Cold Starts      | 50k RPS   |

### 15.2 Comprehensive Pytest Suite for Behavioral
A production-grade system requires testing across all failure domains. Below is the definitive pytest suite for testing Behavioral against race conditions, network failures, and database locks.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.db import transaction, DatabaseError

@pytest.fixture
def setup_behavioral():
    return {"status": "initialized", "topic": "Behavioral"}

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_happy_path_behavioral(setup_behavioral):
    """Test the standard execution flow without errors."""
    result = perform_behavioral_action()
    assert result.status == "success"

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_race_condition_behavioral():
    """Simulate concurrent requests to ensure row locks (select_for_update) hold."""
    import threading
    
    exceptions = []
    def worker():
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Simulate the lock and process
                perform_behavioral_action()
        except Exception as e:
            exceptions.append(e)

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(5)]
    for t in threads: t.start()
    for t in threads: t.join()
    
    # 1 succeeds, 4 fail with concurrency exceptions
    assert len(exceptions) == 4

@patch('requests.post')
def test_network_timeout_behavioral(mock_post):
    """Ensure system degrades gracefully when upstream is slow."""
    import requests
    mock_post.side_effect = requests.exceptions.Timeout("Connection timed out")
    
    with pytest.raises(ServiceUnavailableError):
         perform_behavioral_action()
```

### 15.3 Multi-Environment Comparison
| Environment | State Management | Concurrency | Latency | Debugging Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Local Dev** | SQLite / Local Redis | Single-threaded | < 5ms | Use `pdb` / `ipdb`, inspect local logs. |
| **Docker Compose** | Containerized PG | Local Gunicorn | ~10ms | Docker exec, attach debugger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Ephemeral DBs | Parallel Pytest | ~50ms | View artifacts, capture stdout/stderr. |
| **Staging (EKS)** | RDS Multi-AZ | HPA, 5 pods | ~30ms | Datadog/New Relic APM tracing. |
| **Production (100k RPS)**| RDS Read Replicas | KEDA + HPA, 500 pods | ~25ms | Distributed tracing, log aggregation (ELK). |

### 15.4 Django Internal Execution Trace for Behavioral
To truly master Behavioral, you must understand how Django handles it at the framework level.

1. **WSGI/ASGI Entrypoint**: Gunicorn receives the HTTP request and hands it to Django's `WSGIHandler`.
2. **Middleware Chain**: The request passes through `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware.
3. **URL Routing**: `URLResolver` matches the path to the specific view for Behavioral.
4. **View Execution**:
   - Authentication & Permissions are verified.
   - Database queries are generated via the ORM. (Watch out for N+1 queries here!)
   - Context is passed to the Template or serialized via DRF.
5. **Database Transaction**: If `ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True` or `transaction.atomic()` is used, a `BEGIN` statement is executed.
6. **Response Generation**: The view returns an `HttpResponse`.
7. **Middleware Teardown**: Middleware processes the response (e.g., adding headers).
8. **DB Commit/Rollback**: The transaction is committed. If an exception occurred, it rolls back.

### 15.5 Ticking Time Bomb Anti-Patterns
🔴 **Anti-Pattern 1: Unbounded Queries in Behavioral**
```python
# Ticking Time Bomb: This works locally with 10 rows.
# In prod, with 10M rows, it crashes the database and exhausts memory.
data = list(MyModel.objects.all())
```
✅ **The Fix:** Pagination, chunking, or streaming.
```python
# Staff-level fix
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
paginator = Paginator(MyModel.objects.order_by('id'), 1000)
for page in paginator.page_range:
    process(paginator.page(page).object_list)
```

🔴 **Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Indexes for Behavioral**
Querying by a non-indexed column in PostgreSQL will result in a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`). On a large table, this causes high CPU usage and slow responses.
✅ **The Fix:** Use `db_index=True`, `Meta.indexes`, or `GinIndex` for JSONB fields.

### 15.6 Resolution Playbook for Severity-1 Incidents
When a SEV-1 incident strikes related to Behavioral, follow this strict playbook:
1. **Acknowledge & Escalate:** Announce on `#incident-response`. PagerDuty alerts should be silenced.
2. **Mitigate, Don't Fix:** Your goal is to stop the bleeding, not write the perfect patch.
   - Scale up replicas? `kubectl scale deploy --replicas=50 app-name`
   - Block traffic? Add a WAF rule blocking the abusive IP or User Agent.
   - Revert deployment? Run the rollback CI pipeline.
3. **Investigation:** Look at APM traces. Are DB queries taking 5 seconds? Is Redis evicting keys?
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Post-incident, write an ADR detailing *why* it happened (e.g., Cache Stampede, missing lock) and implement long-term fixes (Circuit Breaker, Outbox Pattern).

# Ticking Time Bomb: This works locally with 10 rows.
# In prod, with 10M rows, it crashes the database and exhausts memory.
data = list(MyModel.objects.all())
```
✅ **The Fix:** Pagination, chunking, or streaming.
```python
# Staff-level fix
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
paginator = Paginator(MyModel.objects.order_by('id'), 1000)
for page in paginator.page_range:
    process(paginator.page(page).object_list)
```

🔴 **Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Indexes for Behavioral**
Querying by a non-indexed column in PostgreSQL will result in a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`). On a large table, this causes high CPU usage and slow responses.
✅ **The Fix:** Use `db_index=True`, `Meta.indexes`, or `GinIndex` for JSONB fields.

### 15.6 Resolution Playbook for Severity-1 Incidents
When a SEV-1 incident strikes related to Behavioral, follow this strict playbook:
1. **Acknowledge & Escalate:** Announce on `#incident-response`. PagerDuty alerts should be silenced.
2. **Mitigate, Don't Fix:** Your goal is to stop the bleeding, not write the perfect patch.
   - Scale up replicas? `kubectl scale deploy --replicas=50 app-name`
   - Block traffic? Add a WAF rule blocking the abusive IP or User Agent.
   - Revert deployment? Run the rollback CI pipeline.
3. **Investigation:** Look at APM traces. Are DB queries taking 5 seconds? Is Redis evicting keys?
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Post-incident, write an ADR detailing *why* it happened (e.g., Cache Stampede, missing lock) and implement long-term fixes (Circuit Breaker, Outbox Pattern).


## 15. The Complete Staff-Level Guide to Behavioral
This section contains a deep dive into the 30-Point Framework for Behavioral.

### 15.1 Real-World Trade-Offs Matrix
| Architecture Choice | Pros for Behavioral | Cons for Behavioral | Max Scale |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Monolithic Default  | Easy to deploy   | High coupling    | 1k RPS    |
| Microservice Extracted | Independent scaling | Network overhead | 10k RPS   |
| Event-Driven Kafka  | Eventual Consistency | High Complexity  | 100k+ RPS |
| Serverless / Lambda | Scale to zero    | Cold Starts      | 50k RPS   |

### 15.2 Comprehensive Pytest Suite for Behavioral
A production-grade system requires testing across all failure domains. Below is the definitive pytest suite for testing Behavioral against race conditions, network failures, and database locks.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.db import transaction, DatabaseError

@pytest.fixture
def setup_behavioral():
    return {"status": "initialized", "topic": "Behavioral"}

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_happy_path_behavioral(setup_behavioral):
    """Test the standard execution flow without errors."""
    result = perform_behavioral_action()
    assert result.status == "success"

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_race_condition_behavioral():
    """Simulate concurrent requests to ensure row locks (select_for_update) hold."""
    import threading
    
    exceptions = []
    def worker():
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Simulate the lock and process
                perform_behavioral_action()
        except Exception as e:
            exceptions.append(e)

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(5)]
    for t in threads: t.start()
    for t in threads: t.join()
    
    # 1 succeeds, 4 fail with concurrency exceptions
    assert len(exceptions) == 4

@patch('requests.post')
def test_network_timeout_behavioral(mock_post):
    """Ensure system degrades gracefully when upstream is slow."""
    import requests
    mock_post.side_effect = requests.exceptions.Timeout("Connection timed out")
    
    with pytest.raises(ServiceUnavailableError):
         perform_behavioral_action()
```

### 15.3 Multi-Environment Comparison
| Environment | State Management | Concurrency | Latency | Debugging Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Local Dev** | SQLite / Local Redis | Single-threaded | < 5ms | Use `pdb` / `ipdb`, inspect local logs. |
| **Docker Compose** | Containerized PG | Local Gunicorn | ~10ms | Docker exec, attach debugger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Ephemeral DBs | Parallel Pytest | ~50ms | View artifacts, capture stdout/stderr. |
| **Staging (EKS)** | RDS Multi-AZ | HPA, 5 pods | ~30ms | Datadog/New Relic APM tracing. |
| **Production (100k RPS)**| RDS Read Replicas | KEDA + HPA, 500 pods | ~25ms | Distributed tracing, log aggregation (ELK). |

### 15.4 Django Internal Execution Trace for Behavioral
To truly master Behavioral, you must understand how Django handles it at the framework level.

1. **WSGI/ASGI Entrypoint**: Gunicorn receives the HTTP request and hands it to Django's `WSGIHandler`.
2. **Middleware Chain**: The request passes through `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware.
3. **URL Routing**: `URLResolver` matches the path to the specific view for Behavioral.
4. **View Execution**:
   - Authentication & Permissions are verified.
   - Database queries are generated via the ORM. (Watch out for N+1 queries here!)
   - Context is passed to the Template or serialized via DRF.
5. **Database Transaction**: If `ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True` or `transaction.atomic()` is used, a `BEGIN` statement is executed.
6. **Response Generation**: The view returns an `HttpResponse`.
7. **Middleware Teardown**: Middleware processes the response (e.g., adding headers).
8. **DB Commit/Rollback**: The transaction is committed. If an exception occurred, it rolls back.
