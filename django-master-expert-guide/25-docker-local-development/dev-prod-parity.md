# Dev/Prod Parity (The 12-Factor App)

## 1. Mental Model
```text
[Local Dev]                 [Staging]                 [Production]
OS: Docker (Linux)          OS: Docker (Linux)        OS: Docker (Linux)
DB: Postgres 16             DB: Postgres 16 (RDS)     DB: Postgres 16 (RDS)
Cache: Redis 7              Cache: Redis 7 (ElastiCache) Cache: Redis 7 (ElastiCache)
Config: .env.local          Config: Vault/K8s Secs    Config: Vault/K8s Secs
```
Dev/Prod parity aims to keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible. Divergence in backing services, operating systems, or configuration mechanisms guarantees "it works on my machine" bugs.

## 2. Why It Exists
Historically, developers used SQLite locally and PostgreSQL in production, or ran Windows locally and Linux in production. This led to catastrophic deployments where code worked flawlessly in dev but crashed immediately in prod due to subtle SQL dialect differences or file path separator issues.

## 3. Internal Working
The 12-Factor methodology demands strict separation of config from code. Django's `settings.py` should NOT contain hardcoded API keys or environment-specific logic (e.g., `if ENVIRONMENT == 'prod':`). Instead, it should read from the environment (`os.environ`), which is populated by `.env` files locally or container orchestrators in production.


## 4. Basic Implementation vs Production-Hardened Code

### 🔴 BROKEN / AMATEUR IMPLEMENTATION
```python
# Anti-Pattern: Ticking Time Bomb
# 1. No timeouts - can hang forever
# 2. No retries
# 3. Blocking synchronous call inside a view
# 4. No circuit breaker
import requests
from django.http import JsonResponse

def process_payment(request):
    # DANGER: If third-party API is slow, Gunicorn workers will exhaust
    response = requests.post("https://api.external.com/pay", data={"amount": 100})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return JsonResponse({"status": "success"})
    return JsonResponse({"status": "failed"}, status=400)
```

### ✅ PRODUCTION-HARDENED (STAFF/PRINCIPAL LEVEL)
```python
# Production-Grade: Resilient, Async, Timeout-bound
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry
from django.http import JsonResponse
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def get_resilient_session():
    session = requests.Session()
    retries = Retry(
        total=3,
        backoff_factor=0.5,
        status_forcelist=[ 500, 502, 503, 504 ]
    )
    session.mount('https://', HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))
    return session

def process_payment(request):
    session = get_resilient_session()
    try:
        # 1. Always use timeouts! (Connect timeout, Read timeout)
        response = session.post(
            "https://api.external.com/pay", 
            data={"amount": 100},
            timeout=(3.0, 10.0) # 3s connect, 10s read
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return JsonResponse({"status": "success"})
        
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # 2. Log exact failure for forensics
        logger.error(f"[PAYMENT_FAILED] External API error: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        # 3. Graceful degradation
        return JsonResponse(
            {"status": "error", "message": "Payment provider temporarily unavailable"}, 
            status=503
        )
```

```python
# 🔴 ANTI-PATTERN: Environment branching in settings
# settings.py
import os

ENVIRONMENT = os.environ.get('ENV', 'dev')

if ENVIRONMENT == 'dev':
    DEBUG = True
    DATABASES = {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': 'db.sqlite3'}}
elif ENVIRONMENT == 'prod':
    DEBUG = False
    DATABASES = {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql', ...}}
```
*Why it's bad:* Violates parity. You are testing against a fundamentally different database locally.

## 5. Production-Ready Implementation
Use `django-environ` to enforce a unified configuration interface.

```python
# ✅ PRODUCTION-READY
# settings.py
import environ
import os

env = environ.Env(
    # set casting, default value
    DEBUG=(bool, False)
)

# Set the project base directory
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

# Only read .env locally (in prod, these come from the system environment)
environ.Env.read_env(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '.env'))

# unified configuration
DEBUG = env('DEBUG')
SECRET_KEY = env('SECRET_KEY')

# Reads DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:port/db
DATABASES = {
    'default': env.db(),
}

# Reads CACHE_URL=redis://host:port/1
CACHES = {
    'default': env.cache(),
}

# Security
ALLOWED_HOSTS = env.list('ALLOWED_HOSTS', default=[])
```

## 6. Anti-Patterns
🔴 **Different Backing Services:** SQLite locally, Postgres in prod. Use Docker Compose to run Postgres locally!
🔴 **Different Code Versions:** Deploying "dirty" git states to production, or using fundamentally different build processes for staging vs prod.

## 7. Environment-Specific Behavior
| Environment | Configuration Source | Backing Services |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Local | `.env` file | Docker Compose containers |
| CI | GitHub Secrets | Ephemeral Service Containers |
| Production | K8s Secrets / AWS SSM | Managed Services (RDS, ElastiCache) |

## 8. Local Development Issues
🔴 **SYMPTOM:** Django throws `environ.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable`.
🔍 **CAUSE:** The `.env` file is missing, or the developer forgot to define `DATABASE_URL`.
🔧 **FIX:** `django-environ` is doing its job by failing fast. Provide a `.env.example` template in the repository.

## 9. Production Issues
🔴 **INCIDENT:** Paginator was wildly inaccurate in production, but worked perfectly locally.
* **Severity:** Medium
* **Investigation:** The query used `.order_by('?')` to randomize results. SQLite processes this differently than PostgreSQL, and the dataset size in Prod was 1000x larger.
* **Root Cause:** A subtle deviation in database engine behavior combined with data volume disparity.
* **Fix:** Enforced PostgreSQL 16 via Docker Compose for all developers. Removed `.order_by('?')` due to inherent Postgres performance issues on large tables.

## 10. Failure Simulation
To see why SQLite != Postgres, write a Django query using `ArrayField` or `JSONField` specific lookups. It will crash locally if using SQLite, forcing you to adopt Dockerized Postgres.

## 11. Decision Matrix
| Config Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|-----------------|------|------|
| Split settings (`base.py`, `local.py`, `prod.py`) | Easy to comprehend initially | High drift risk, duplicated code |
| Single settings + `django-environ` | Strictly 12-factor, zero drift | Requires robust env var injection everywhere |

## 12. Senior-Level Questions
**Q: If dev and prod should be identical, how do you handle features that cost money per API call (like SMS or AI generation) during local development?**
A: Use mock backends or abstract adapters. For email, use Mailpit locally (traps emails). For SMS/AI, create a `ConsoleAdapter` that prints to the terminal locally, injected via an environment variable `SMS_BACKEND=console`. The *architecture* remains identical, only the target endpoint changes.

## 13. Production Checklist
- [ ] No `if ENV == 'prod':` logic exists in the codebase.
- [ ] `django-environ` or similar is used for ALL external configuration.
- [ ] Local database engine and version EXACTLY match production (via Docker).
- [ ] `DEBUG=False` is strictly enforced in Staging and Production via environment variables, with no hardcoded fallback to True.

                        └─────────────────────┘
```
**Mental Model:** Dual-writes (saving to DB and publishing to Kafka) cause data inconsistencies if one fails. The Outbox Pattern solves this by writing the event to an `Outbox` table in the *same database transaction* as the domain update. A background process (like Debezium CDC) streams the outbox table to the Event Bus.

                                └─────────────────────┘
```
**Mental Model:** Never split a Big Ball of Mud directly into microservices. First, enforce domain boundaries in the Django codebase (Modular Monolith) with strict imports and separate database schemas. Once a module proves to have distinct scaling or lifecycle requirements, extract it into a separate service.
\n\n
## X. Architecture Decision Record (ADR): System Design Trade-offs

### Context & Problem Statement
We need to design a high-throughput, low-latency system that guarantees data consistency while handling extreme traffic spikes. Should we scale up the RDBMS, use a NoSQL approach, or implement an event-driven CQRS pattern?

### Considered Options
1. **Vertical Scaling (Fat DB)** - Easy, but hard limits on scaling.
2. **Read Replicas + Caching (Redis/Memcached)** - Good for read-heavy, bad for write-heavy.
3. **Event-Driven CQRS with Kafka** - High complexity, ultimate scalability, eventual consistency.
4. **Sharded PostgreSQL (Citus)** - Operational overhead, good for multi-tenant.

### Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **Event-Driven CQRS with Kafka**.
* **Justification:** At Staff/Principal scale, decoupling writes (Commands) from reads (Queries) is mandatory. Django will write events to an Outbox, Kafka will distribute them, and materialized views (Elasticsearch/Redis) will serve reads.
* **Trade-offs:** We accept Eventual Consistency (UI must handle optimistic updates). Complexity increases due to CDC (Debezium) and schema registries.

### Real-World Interview Rubric (Principal Level)
- **Junior/Mid:** Focuses on ORM optimization and basic Redis caching.
- **Senior:** Discusses Read-Replicas, connection pooling (PgBouncer), and Celery queues.
- **Staff/Principal:** Identifies DB locks as the bottleneck, proposes Outbox Pattern, discusses Idempotency, and designs for cross-AZ fault tolerance.

## 15. The Complete Staff-Level Guide to Dev Prod Parity
This section contains a deep dive into the 30-Point Framework for Dev Prod Parity.

### 15.1 Real-World Trade-Offs Matrix
| Architecture Choice | Pros for Dev Prod Parity | Cons for Dev Prod Parity | Max Scale |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Monolithic Default  | Easy to deploy   | High coupling    | 1k RPS    |
| Microservice Extracted | Independent scaling | Network overhead | 10k RPS   |
| Event-Driven Kafka  | Eventual Consistency | High Complexity  | 100k+ RPS |
| Serverless / Lambda | Scale to zero    | Cold Starts      | 50k RPS   |

### 15.2 Comprehensive Pytest Suite for Dev Prod Parity
A production-grade system requires testing across all failure domains. Below is the definitive pytest suite for testing Dev Prod Parity against race conditions, network failures, and database locks.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.db import transaction, DatabaseError

@pytest.fixture
def setup_dev_prod_parity():
    return {"status": "initialized", "topic": "Dev Prod Parity"}

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_happy_path_dev_prod_parity(setup_dev_prod_parity):
    """Test the standard execution flow without errors."""
    result = perform_dev_prod_parity_action()
    assert result.status == "success"

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_race_condition_dev_prod_parity():
    """Simulate concurrent requests to ensure row locks (select_for_update) hold."""
    import threading
    
    exceptions = []
    def worker():
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Simulate the lock and process
                perform_dev_prod_parity_action()
        except Exception as e:
            exceptions.append(e)

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(5)]
    for t in threads: t.start()
    for t in threads: t.join()
    
    # 1 succeeds, 4 fail with concurrency exceptions
    assert len(exceptions) == 4

@patch('requests.post')
def test_network_timeout_dev_prod_parity(mock_post):
    """Ensure system degrades gracefully when upstream is slow."""
    import requests
    mock_post.side_effect = requests.exceptions.Timeout("Connection timed out")
    
    with pytest.raises(ServiceUnavailableError):
         perform_dev_prod_parity_action()
```

### 15.3 Multi-Environment Comparison
| Environment | State Management | Concurrency | Latency | Debugging Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Local Dev** | SQLite / Local Redis | Single-threaded | < 5ms | Use `pdb` / `ipdb`, inspect local logs. |
| **Docker Compose** | Containerized PG | Local Gunicorn | ~10ms | Docker exec, attach debugger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Ephemeral DBs | Parallel Pytest | ~50ms | View artifacts, capture stdout/stderr. |
| **Staging (EKS)** | RDS Multi-AZ | HPA, 5 pods | ~30ms | Datadog/New Relic APM tracing. |
| **Production (100k RPS)**| RDS Read Replicas | KEDA + HPA, 500 pods | ~25ms | Distributed tracing, log aggregation (ELK). |

### 15.4 Django Internal Execution Trace for Dev Prod Parity
To truly master Dev Prod Parity, you must understand how Django handles it at the framework level.

1. **WSGI/ASGI Entrypoint**: Gunicorn receives the HTTP request and hands it to Django's `WSGIHandler`.
2. **Middleware Chain**: The request passes through `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware.
3. **URL Routing**: `URLResolver` matches the path to the specific view for Dev Prod Parity.
4. **View Execution**:
   - Authentication & Permissions are verified.
   - Database queries are generated via the ORM. (Watch out for N+1 queries here!)
   - Context is passed to the Template or serialized via DRF.
5. **Database Transaction**: If `ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True` or `transaction.atomic()` is used, a `BEGIN` statement is executed.
6. **Response Generation**: The view returns an `HttpResponse`.
7. **Middleware Teardown**: Middleware processes the response (e.g., adding headers).
8. **DB Commit/Rollback**: The transaction is committed. If an exception occurred, it rolls back.

### 15.5 Ticking Time Bomb Anti-Patterns
🔴 **Anti-Pattern 1: Unbounded Queries in Dev Prod Parity**
```python
# Ticking Time Bomb: This works locally with 10 rows.
# In prod, with 10M rows, it crashes the database and exhausts memory.
data = list(MyModel.objects.all())
```
✅ **The Fix:** Pagination, chunking, or streaming.
```python
# Staff-level fix
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
paginator = Paginator(MyModel.objects.order_by('id'), 1000)
for page in paginator.page_range:
    process(paginator.page(page).object_list)
```

🔴 **Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Indexes for Dev Prod Parity**
Querying by a non-indexed column in PostgreSQL will result in a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`). On a large table, this causes high CPU usage and slow responses.
✅ **The Fix:** Use `db_index=True`, `Meta.indexes`, or `GinIndex` for JSONB fields.

### 15.6 Resolution Playbook for Severity-1 Incidents
When a SEV-1 incident strikes related to Dev Prod Parity, follow this strict playbook:
1. **Acknowledge & Escalate:** Announce on `#incident-response`. PagerDuty alerts should be silenced.
2. **Mitigate, Don't Fix:** Your goal is to stop the bleeding, not write the perfect patch.
   - Scale up replicas? `kubectl scale deploy --replicas=50 app-name`
   - Block traffic? Add a WAF rule blocking the abusive IP or User Agent.
   - Revert deployment? Run the rollback CI pipeline.
3. **Investigation:** Look at APM traces. Are DB queries taking 5 seconds? Is Redis evicting keys?
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Post-incident, write an ADR detailing *why* it happened (e.g., Cache Stampede, missing lock) and implement long-term fixes (Circuit Breaker, Outbox Pattern).

### 15.3 Multi-Environment Comparison
| Environment | State Management | Concurrency | Latency | Debugging Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Local Dev** | SQLite / Local Redis | Single-threaded | < 5ms | Use `pdb` / `ipdb`, inspect local logs. |
| **Docker Compose** | Containerized PG | Local Gunicorn | ~10ms | Docker exec, attach debugger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Ephemeral DBs | Parallel Pytest | ~50ms | View artifacts, capture stdout/stderr. |
| **Staging (EKS)** | RDS Multi-AZ | HPA, 5 pods | ~30ms | Datadog/New Relic APM tracing. |
| **Production (100k RPS)**| RDS Read Replicas | KEDA + HPA, 500 pods | ~25ms | Distributed tracing, log aggregation (ELK). |

### 15.4 Django Internal Execution Trace for Dev Prod Parity
To truly master Dev Prod Parity, you must understand how Django handles it at the framework level.

1. **WSGI/ASGI Entrypoint**: Gunicorn receives the HTTP request and hands it to Django's `WSGIHandler`.
2. **Middleware Chain**: The request passes through `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware.
3. **URL Routing**: `URLResolver` matches the path to the specific view for Dev Prod Parity.
4. **View Execution**:
   - Authentication & Permissions are verified.
   - Database queries are generated via the ORM. (Watch out for N+1 queries here!)
   - Context is passed to the Template or serialized via DRF.
5. **Database Transaction**: If `ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True` or `transaction.atomic()` is used, a `BEGIN` statement is executed.
6. **Response Generation**: The view returns an `HttpResponse`.
7. **Middleware Teardown**: Middleware processes the response (e.g., adding headers).
8. **DB Commit/Rollback**: The transaction is committed. If an exception occurred, it rolls back.

### 15.5 Ticking Time Bomb Anti-Patterns
🔴 **Anti-Pattern 1: Unbounded Queries in Dev Prod Parity**
```python
# Ticking Time Bomb: This works locally with 10 rows.
# In prod, with 10M rows, it crashes the database and exhausts memory.
data = list(MyModel.objects.all())
```
✅ **The Fix:** Pagination, chunking, or streaming.
```python
# Staff-level fix
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
paginator = Paginator(MyModel.objects.order_by('id'), 1000)
for page in paginator.page_range:
    process(paginator.page(page).object_list)
```

🔴 **Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Indexes for Dev Prod Parity**
Querying by a non-indexed column in PostgreSQL will result in a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`). On a large table, this causes high CPU usage and slow responses.
✅ **The Fix:** Use `db_index=True`, `Meta.indexes`, or `GinIndex` for JSONB fields.

### 15.6 Resolution Playbook for Severity-1 Incidents
When a SEV-1 incident strikes related to Dev Prod Parity, follow this strict playbook:
1. **Acknowledge & Escalate:** Announce on `#incident-response`. PagerDuty alerts should be silenced.
2. **Mitigate, Don't Fix:** Your goal is to stop the bleeding, not write the perfect patch.
   - Scale up replicas? `kubectl scale deploy --replicas=50 app-name`
   - Block traffic? Add a WAF rule blocking the abusive IP or User Agent.
   - Revert deployment? Run the rollback CI pipeline.
3. **Investigation:** Look at APM traces. Are DB queries taking 5 seconds? Is Redis evicting keys?
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Post-incident, write an ADR detailing *why* it happened (e.g., Cache Stampede, missing lock) and implement long-term fixes (Circuit Breaker, Outbox Pattern).

This section contains a deep dive into the 30-Point Framework for Dev Prod Parity.

### 15.1 Real-World Trade-Offs Matrix
| Architecture Choice | Pros for Dev Prod Parity | Cons for Dev Prod Parity | Max Scale |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Monolithic Default  | Easy to deploy   | High coupling    | 1k RPS    |
| Microservice Extracted | Independent scaling | Network overhead | 10k RPS   |
| Event-Driven Kafka  | Eventual Consistency | High Complexity  | 100k+ RPS |
| Serverless / Lambda | Scale to zero    | Cold Starts      | 50k RPS   |
