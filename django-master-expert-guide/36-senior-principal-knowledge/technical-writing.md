# Technical Writing for Senior Engineers

## Mental Model
Code solves a problem for a computer today. Technical writing solves a problem for an engineer tomorrow. A Staff engineer writes less code and more documents, aligning dozens of engineers on a single technical direction.

```text
[ Vague Idea ] -> [ RFC (Feedback) ] -> [ Design Doc (Blueprint) ] -> [ ADR (Decision Log) ] -> [ Code ]
```

## 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

An ADR captures a single, specific architectural decision, the context in which it was made, and its consequences. It prevents the team from re-litigating the same decision 6 months later.

### Standard ADR Template
- **Title:** e.g., "ADR 004: Use Celery for Background Jobs instead of Django-RQ"
- **Status:** Proposed / Accepted / Rejected / Superseded
- **Context:** We are introducing asynchronous processing. We evaluated RQ, Celery, and Huey. Our team has deep Redis experience, but we need advanced workflows (chords, groups) which RQ lacks natively.
- **Decision:** We will adopt Celery with Redis as the broker.
- **Consequences:**
  - *Positive:* Native support for complex workflows, massive community.
  - *Negative:* High operational complexity, configuration footprint is large.

## 2. Request for Comments (RFCs)

RFCs are used to propose a significant change before writing code. The goal is to build consensus and uncover blind spots.

### Key Sections of an RFC
1. **Summary:** 3-sentence elevator pitch.
2. **Motivation:** Why are we doing this *now*? What breaks if we don't?
3. **Proposed Implementation:** How it will work (High-level architecture, DB schema changes).
4. **Drawbacks:** Why should we *not* do this? (If you leave this blank, you haven't thought hard enough).
5. **Alternatives Considered:** What other tools were evaluated and why were they rejected?
6. **Rollout Plan:** Feature flags, data backfills, zero-downtime strategy.

## 3. System Design Documents

A living document that describes how a major component works. This is what you hand to a new hire.

### The "Django Specific" System Doc Checklist
- **Component Diagram:** Mermaid.js or ASCII showing Nginx, Gunicorn, DB, Cache.
- **Data Model:** Core PostgreSQL tables and their relationships.
- **Critical Paths:** Sequence diagrams for the most important user journeys (e.g., Checkout Flow).
- **Failure Modes:** Document what happens if Redis dies, if Stripe API is down, or if the DB runs out of connections.

## 15. The Complete Staff-Level Guide to Technical Writing
This section contains a deep dive into the 30-Point Framework for Technical Writing.

### 15.1 Real-World Trade-Offs Matrix
| Architecture Choice | Pros for Technical Writing | Cons for Technical Writing | Max Scale |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Monolithic Default  | Easy to deploy   | High coupling    | 1k RPS    |
| Microservice Extracted | Independent scaling | Network overhead | 10k RPS   |
| Event-Driven Kafka  | Eventual Consistency | High Complexity  | 100k+ RPS |
| Serverless / Lambda | Scale to zero    | Cold Starts      | 50k RPS   |

### 15.2 Comprehensive Pytest Suite for Technical Writing
A production-grade system requires testing across all failure domains. Below is the definitive pytest suite for testing Technical Writing against race conditions, network failures, and database locks.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.db import transaction, DatabaseError

@pytest.fixture
def setup_technical_writing():
    return {"status": "initialized", "topic": "Technical Writing"}

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_happy_path_technical_writing(setup_technical_writing):
    """Test the standard execution flow without errors."""
    result = perform_technical_writing_action()
    assert result.status == "success"

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_race_condition_technical_writing():
    """Simulate concurrent requests to ensure row locks (select_for_update) hold."""
    import threading
    
    exceptions = []
    def worker():
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                # Simulate the lock and process
                perform_technical_writing_action()
        except Exception as e:
            exceptions.append(e)

    threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(5)]
    for t in threads: t.start()
    for t in threads: t.join()
    
    # 1 succeeds, 4 fail with concurrency exceptions
    assert len(exceptions) == 4

@patch('requests.post')
def test_network_timeout_technical_writing(mock_post):
    """Ensure system degrades gracefully when upstream is slow."""
    import requests
    mock_post.side_effect = requests.exceptions.Timeout("Connection timed out")
    
    with pytest.raises(ServiceUnavailableError):
         perform_technical_writing_action()
```

### 15.3 Multi-Environment Comparison
| Environment | State Management | Concurrency | Latency | Debugging Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Local Dev** | SQLite / Local Redis | Single-threaded | < 5ms | Use `pdb` / `ipdb`, inspect local logs. |
| **Docker Compose** | Containerized PG | Local Gunicorn | ~10ms | Docker exec, attach debugger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Ephemeral DBs | Parallel Pytest | ~50ms | View artifacts, capture stdout/stderr. |
| **Staging (EKS)** | RDS Multi-AZ | HPA, 5 pods | ~30ms | Datadog/New Relic APM tracing. |
| **Production (100k RPS)**| RDS Read Replicas | KEDA + HPA, 500 pods | ~25ms | Distributed tracing, log aggregation (ELK). |

### 15.4 Django Internal Execution Trace for Technical Writing
To truly master Technical Writing, you must understand how Django handles it at the framework level.

1. **WSGI/ASGI Entrypoint**: Gunicorn receives the HTTP request and hands it to Django's `WSGIHandler`.
2. **Middleware Chain**: The request passes through `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware.
3. **URL Routing**: `URLResolver` matches the path to the specific view for Technical Writing.
4. **View Execution**:
   - Authentication & Permissions are verified.
   - Database queries are generated via the ORM. (Watch out for N+1 queries here!)
   - Context is passed to the Template or serialized via DRF.
5. **Database Transaction**: If `ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True` or `transaction.atomic()` is used, a `BEGIN` statement is executed.
6. **Response Generation**: The view returns an `HttpResponse`.
7. **Middleware Teardown**: Middleware processes the response (e.g., adding headers).
8. **DB Commit/Rollback**: The transaction is committed. If an exception occurred, it rolls back.

### 15.5 Ticking Time Bomb Anti-Patterns
🔴 **Anti-Pattern 1: Unbounded Queries in Technical Writing**
```python
# Ticking Time Bomb: This works locally with 10 rows.
# In prod, with 10M rows, it crashes the database and exhausts memory.
data = list(MyModel.objects.all())
```
✅ **The Fix:** Pagination, chunking, or streaming.
```python
# Staff-level fix
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
paginator = Paginator(MyModel.objects.order_by('id'), 1000)
for page in paginator.page_range:
    process(paginator.page(page).object_list)
```

🔴 **Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Indexes for Technical Writing**
Querying by a non-indexed column in PostgreSQL will result in a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`). On a large table, this causes high CPU usage and slow responses.
✅ **The Fix:** Use `db_index=True`, `Meta.indexes`, or `GinIndex` for JSONB fields.

### 15.6 Resolution Playbook for Severity-1 Incidents
When a SEV-1 incident strikes related to Technical Writing, follow this strict playbook:
1. **Acknowledge & Escalate:** Announce on `#incident-response`. PagerDuty alerts should be silenced.
2. **Mitigate, Don't Fix:** Your goal is to stop the bleeding, not write the perfect patch.
   - Scale up replicas? `kubectl scale deploy --replicas=50 app-name`
   - Block traffic? Add a WAF rule blocking the abusive IP or User Agent.
   - Revert deployment? Run the rollback CI pipeline.
3. **Investigation:** Look at APM traces. Are DB queries taking 5 seconds? Is Redis evicting keys?
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Post-incident, write an ADR detailing *why* it happened (e.g., Cache Stampede, missing lock) and implement long-term fixes (Circuit Breaker, Outbox Pattern).

### 15.3 Multi-Environment Comparison
| Environment | State Management | Concurrency | Latency | Debugging Strategy |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| **Local Dev** | SQLite / Local Redis | Single-threaded | < 5ms | Use `pdb` / `ipdb`, inspect local logs. |
| **Docker Compose** | Containerized PG | Local Gunicorn | ~10ms | Docker exec, attach debugger. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | Ephemeral DBs | Parallel Pytest | ~50ms | View artifacts, capture stdout/stderr. |
| **Staging (EKS)** | RDS Multi-AZ | HPA, 5 pods | ~30ms | Datadog/New Relic APM tracing. |
| **Production (100k RPS)**| RDS Read Replicas | KEDA + HPA, 500 pods | ~25ms | Distributed tracing, log aggregation (ELK). |

### 15.4 Django Internal Execution Trace for Technical Writing
To truly master Technical Writing, you must understand how Django handles it at the framework level.

1. **WSGI/ASGI Entrypoint**: Gunicorn receives the HTTP request and hands it to Django's `WSGIHandler`.
2. **Middleware Chain**: The request passes through `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware.
3. **URL Routing**: `URLResolver` matches the path to the specific view for Technical Writing.
4. **View Execution**:
   - Authentication & Permissions are verified.
   - Database queries are generated via the ORM. (Watch out for N+1 queries here!)
   - Context is passed to the Template or serialized via DRF.
5. **Database Transaction**: If `ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True` or `transaction.atomic()` is used, a `BEGIN` statement is executed.
6. **Response Generation**: The view returns an `HttpResponse`.
7. **Middleware Teardown**: Middleware processes the response (e.g., adding headers).
8. **DB Commit/Rollback**: The transaction is committed. If an exception occurred, it rolls back.

### 15.5 Ticking Time Bomb Anti-Patterns
🔴 **Anti-Pattern 1: Unbounded Queries in Technical Writing**
```python
# Ticking Time Bomb: This works locally with 10 rows.
# In prod, with 10M rows, it crashes the database and exhausts memory.
data = list(MyModel.objects.all())
```
✅ **The Fix:** Pagination, chunking, or streaming.
```python
# Staff-level fix
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
paginator = Paginator(MyModel.objects.order_by('id'), 1000)
for page in paginator.page_range:
    process(paginator.page(page).object_list)
```

🔴 **Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Indexes for Technical Writing**
Querying by a non-indexed column in PostgreSQL will result in a Sequential Scan (`Seq Scan`). On a large table, this causes high CPU usage and slow responses.
✅ **The Fix:** Use `db_index=True`, `Meta.indexes`, or `GinIndex` for JSONB fields.

### 15.6 Resolution Playbook for Severity-1 Incidents
When a SEV-1 incident strikes related to Technical Writing, follow this strict playbook:
1. **Acknowledge & Escalate:** Announce on `#incident-response`. PagerDuty alerts should be silenced.
2. **Mitigate, Don't Fix:** Your goal is to stop the bleeding, not write the perfect patch.
   - Scale up replicas? `kubectl scale deploy --replicas=50 app-name`
   - Block traffic? Add a WAF rule blocking the abusive IP or User Agent.
   - Revert deployment? Run the rollback CI pipeline.
3. **Investigation:** Look at APM traces. Are DB queries taking 5 seconds? Is Redis evicting keys?
4. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Post-incident, write an ADR detailing *why* it happened (e.g., Cache Stampede, missing lock) and implement long-term fixes (Circuit Breaker, Outbox Pattern).
